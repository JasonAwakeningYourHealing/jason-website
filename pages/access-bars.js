          <h2>What Is Access Bars?</h2>
          <p>
            Access Bars is a gentle hands-on energy process that clears stress, anxiety, looping thoughts, and
            emotional clutter. It involves lightly touching 32 points on the head that relate to different areas
            of life.

          <h2>What People Say</h2>
          <p>
            Clients often describe feeling lighter, clearer, and more spacious after a session. Some report better
            sleep, emotional release, or simply deep relaxation.

          <h2>Why I Offer It</h2>
          <p>
            After years working in education and healing, I trained in Access Bars to offer another doorway to
            wellbeing — one that doesn’t rely on words, stories, or diagnoses.
