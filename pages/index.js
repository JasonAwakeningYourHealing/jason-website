          Welcome — I’m Jason King. I work with individuals of all ages and backgrounds to help them
          thrive, learn, heal, and reconnect. Whether you’re here for personalised SEND tutoring, the
          calming energy of Access Bars, or one-to-one coaching and facilitation, this space was created
          for you.

          I bring over 15 years of experience, deep listening, and an open heart to every session. My
          approach is collaborative, grounded, and curious. There’s no one-size-fits-all here — only what
          works for you.
